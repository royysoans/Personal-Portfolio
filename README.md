## Reflection

- Building this portfolio was fun. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and practiced layouts with flexbox and grid. My favourite part was creating the navbar it was the first time I built one on my own, so that felt rewarding.

- I learned how to create a typing animation for my introduction using JavaScript. Before this project, I had not tried animating text, so it was a new experience.

- I also learned how to set the width of progress bars directly in the HTML for the skills section. This made it easier to adjust each skill without editing the CSS every time.

- **Problems faced:** On small screens the navbar items did not fit and the skills section looked squeezed. I fixed this by reducing the navbar font size with media queries and changing the skills grid to two columns on tablets and one column on phones. I tested on different screen sizes until the layout looked neat.

- Overall, the project helped me brush up on CSS and basic JavaScript. I had been wanting to make a portfolio page for long and I'm glad to have done it finally. I will make sure to keep updating this portfolio page with more features as I learn more things in Web Development.
